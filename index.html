        <h1>About Java</h1>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Java:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning it organizes code around objects and data, rather than functions and logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This is the "write once, run anywhere" principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Java has strong memory management and exception handling features, which contribute to its reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Java was designed with security in mind, offering features like a security manager to control access to resources.</li>
            <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> While interpreted, Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler can achieve performance comparable to compiled languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Compared to some other object-oriented languages, Java has a relatively simple syntax.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Uses of Java:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Applications (server-side)</li>
            <li>Mobile Applications (Android development)</li>
            <li>Enterprise Software</li>
            <li>Big Data Technologies</li>
            <li>Scientific Applications</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is widely used by developers for a vast range of applications.</p>
